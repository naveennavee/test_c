.SH NAME
xrdp\-mkfv1 \- Create .fv1 font files from other font files

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBxrdp-mkfv1\fR [ options ] font_file fv1_file

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBxrdp\-mkfv1\fP can be used to convert a font file such as a TrueType
font to a fv1 file.

.SH OPTIONS
A summary of options is included below.

.TP
\fB\-n\fR <font_name>
Give the font a name, which is stored in the font header.

The default is to use the font family name from the source font.

.TP
\fB\-p\fR <number>
Set the point size of the font. A fixed DPI value of 96 is used for
converting this value into a pixel size.

The default value for this option is '10'.

.TP
\fB\-m\fR <glyph>
Set the limit on the glyphs stored in the font file. The argument is the last
glyph stored in the font file.

Specify the glyph using one of the following strings:

\fBU+<hex>\fR - Unicode character, e.g. \fBU+25\fR for a percentage symbol (%).

\fB@<char>\fR - Unicode character, e.g. \fB@%\fR for a percentage symbol.

\fBnumber\fR - Unicode value as an integer, e.g. \fB37\fR for a
percentage symbol

The default value for this option is 'U+4DFF'.

.TP
\fB\-C\fR
When used with the "DejaVu Sans" font at a point-size of 10, a small
number of glyphs are assigned a different x-offset than they have
when the original Windows font generation program is used.

This switch can be used to preserve the original x-offsets for glyphs in
the range U+0020 - U+00FF when a 10 point DajaVu Sans font is generated.

Use one of the following arguments to this option:-

\fBauto\fR - Automatic mode. Offsets are preserved if a "DajaVu Sans" 10-point font is converted.

\fBon / true / yes\fR - Preserve offsets if automatic font detection does not work.

\fBoff / false / no\fR - Do not tamper with the offsets generated by the program.

The default value of this switch is \fRauto\fR.

To see the effects of this switch, set the \fBMKFV1_LOG_LEVEL\fR environment
variable to \fBinfo\fR before running the program.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.TP
\fBxrdp-mkfv1 -p18 /path/to/DejaVuSans.ttf ./sans-18.fv1\fR

.TP
\fBxrdp-mkfv1 -C off -p10 /path/to/DejaVuSans.ttf ./sans-10.fv1\fR
